# Property Buy and Sell

This is our project for the database course CSE-302. We used HTML, CSS, JavaSript for the frontend. Python and Django for the backend. Oracle as the database. Users can signup and post any types of property like land, apartment and building for sell. Other users can see these posts and buy directly from the sellers. It is like amazon.com but for properties.

The website is not live because the requirment of the course was to deploy the Oracle database locally. Also we were not allowed to use the official Django ORM for database queries and had to hard code the queries.
